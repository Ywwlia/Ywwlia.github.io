Ten little Indian boys went out to dine;  
One choked his little self and then there were nine.
Nine little Indian boys sat up very late;  
One overslept himself and then there were eight.  
Eight little Indian boys travelling in Devon;  
One said he'd stay there and then there were seven.  
Seven little Indian boys chopping up sticks;  
One chopped himself in halves and then there were six.  
Six little Indian boys playing with a hive;  
A bumblebee stung one and then there were five.  
Five little Indian boys going in for law;  
One got in Chancery and then there were four.  
Four little Indian boys going out to sea;  
A red herring swallowed one and then there were three.  
Three little Indian boys walking in the Zoo;  
A big bear hugged one and then there were two.  
Two little Indian boys sitting in the sun;  
One got frizzled up and then there was one.  
One little Indian boy left all alone;  
He went and hanged himself and then there were none.

今年我与杨依依不约而同买了话剧《无人生还》的票，又在她的安利下买了11月《永不消逝的电波》的票。前两日，另有两位基友与我不约而同买了同场的票，我们说可以剧场偶遇。

我与杨依依都是阿加莎·克里斯蒂的书迷，她是9月25日天津场，我是9月30日西安场。剧组大约离开天津就来到了西安。非常巧合的是，我俩的那场话剧都拍了大合照，一眼就认出了大合照里的杨依依。

谨记之以留念。
